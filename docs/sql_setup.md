# Text to SQL Setup

## Preparation

1. Convert structured data in CSV format to SQL DB and make it available in an S3 bucket within a prefix folder.

2. Use synthetic questions in CSV format to train a classification model. The result of 
this process are two pkl files. Save these files also in the same S3 bucket and prefix folder
as in Step 1.
